SWOT:
Strengths: Functional Components and programming logic are my key strengths.

Weaknesses: CSS and aesthetic styling

Opportunities: I will have a chance at honing in CSS skills such as grid to display the data. Will also try and play with dark/light mode.

Threats: Stress and deadlines have always caused a hiccup for me. I will be using this week to manage time and productivity in a manner that will produce a stellar product.
